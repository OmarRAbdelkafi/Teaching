# HTML/CSS
Books is one of the example to produce HTML/CSS code :

We produce a document presenting books. For each book is displayed an image of the cover as well as some information. These information are

- the title
- when the book belongs to a series, the name of this series
- the author
- the year of publication of the book.
- The books are also arranged by categories. These are identified by a different background color from the information section. In the examples provided we propose 3 categories:

* science-fiction (rgb(254,128,128))
* fantasy (rgb(128,128,254))
* bandes-dessin√©es (rgb(238,238,204))

Of all the books, one is identified as a favorite. It is visually distinguished by a different background color.
