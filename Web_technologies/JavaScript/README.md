A project is proposed in this directory:

The page has several areas. On the right is the catalog area where the films are displayed and on the left the area where the two films selected by the user are displayed.

The content of the film catalog is automatically constructed when the page is loaded in relation to data defined in a list. As long as one respects the format of these data, it must be possible to change the data in the list without this requiring to modify the code which allows the loading of the catalog.

The user can browse the different movies. When the mouse hovers one of the films, information is displayed in the lower part of the page, if this one is active. By entering a text in the dedicated area above the films, the user can filter the films displayed: only those whose title contains the entered text are displayed. A check box allows you to choose whether the lower part, the one where the information on the flown movie appears, is displayed (active) or not, depending on whether the box is checked or not.

The user can choose his two favorite movies. These then appear in the left area. In the image below only one movie has been selected. The selection of a movie is done simply by clicking on it. The film has then just been placed in one of the two free slots on the left and is deleted from the catalog on the right. If both locations are already taken, an alert message is displayed. It is possible to remove one of the two chosen films by clicking on it. This is then removed from the selection and returned to the catalog at the end.
